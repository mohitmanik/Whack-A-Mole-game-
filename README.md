Scoring System: Players score points for every successful hit on a mole.
Time Limit: Each level has a time limit within which players must achieve a certain score to progress.
Multiple Levels: As players progress, moles appear faster, and the required score to advance increases.
UI Elements: Score display, timer, level indicators, and game over screen.
